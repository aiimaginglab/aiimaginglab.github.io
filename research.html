        <h3>Generative Models for Imaging</h3>
        <p>Generative models provide a powerful framework for tackling various imaging tasks, from image enhancement and inpainting to style transfer. A central challenge lies in preserving fine details while maintaining high-fidelity realism, pushing the boundaries of generative models beyond conventional synthesis.</p>
